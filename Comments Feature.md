## Architecture for Base App

### First Approach to the architecture

In Reality we dont need to have the **Comments Loader Protocol** since we wont be caching, usually protocols/interfaces are good for when we have more than one use of it. Its always good to simplify things when possible.

### Final Diagram

## How can we create new features without duplicating code/ duplicating HTTPClients?

Starting with the architecture for the already existing FeedModule Feature: 

<img src="/Users/macbook/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20230707125552910.png" alt="image-20230707125552910" style="zoom:50%;" />



We can follow the same design to approach the Comments section: 

<img src="/Users/macbook/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20230707125651095.png" alt="image-20230707125651095" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Upsides**: These both modules are decoupled. Since we dont need multiple strategies, we dont need the **protocol**.

**Downsides**: There is **two** of everything. 



How can we do to avoid duplication?. --> Simplest thing we can do is to keep them in the same module, so the can therefore share the same types:

<img src="/Users/macbook/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20230707125914187.png" alt="image-20230707125914187" style="zoom:50%;" />



But then we lose the modularity that we want. Nonetheless its a good starting point.

- First we implement the `RemoteImageCommentsLoader`
- Then we see how to modularize.
